# Changes

## Unreleased

- Define mini's tiny self-hosting foundation and atomic development rules.
- Add independently versioned CLI tools, JSON verification cases, benchmarks,
  bootstrap checks, and release packaging.
- Add Linux/macOS GitHub CI and tag-triggered releases using direct TypeScript.
- Scope self-hosting to the compiler and record built-in I/O/library direction.
- Reserve the independent `std-v*` release stream; std remains unimplemented.
- Place future standard-library source under `std/`.
- Balance language size with compiler readability and incremental syntax migration.
- Put stream descriptors directly in JSON cases and invoke real tools through
  the shared runner; add `mini verify CASE.json` and remove per-case scripts.

No Mini grammar/compiler/bootstrap exists yet. No release has been published.
